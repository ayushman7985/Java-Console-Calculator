# Java-Console-Calculator
java program
To make a **Java console-based calculator**, you donâ€™t need heavy tools or datasets. Here's a breakdown of what you need:

---

#Tools Required

1. Java Development Kit (JDK)

   * Download from: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
   * Make sure Java is added to the system PATH so you can use it from the command line.

2. Text Editor or IDE

   * Simple Editors:** Notepad, Notepad++, VS Code
   * IDEs (Recommended):

     * IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition)
     * Eclipse
     * NetBeans

3. Command Line / Terminal

   * To compile:

     ```
     javac Calculator.java
     ```
   * To run:

     ```
     java Calculator
     ```

#Dataset Required

* No dataset required.
  A calculator operates on **user input**, not on any dataset. It just takes numbers and operations from the user via `Scanner`.

---

#Basic Java Concepts You'll Use

* Variables
* Loops (optional)
* Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
* Functions/methods
* `Scanner` for user input

#Optional (Advanced Features)

If you want to add more features later:

| Feature                 | What You'll Need                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| GUI Calculator          | Java Swing or JavaFX                  |
| Expression Parsing      | Stack implementation, or libraries    |
| History of calculations | Data structures (List/ArrayList)      |
| Logging to a file       | Java I/O (FileWriter, BufferedWriter) |

#Simple Example Flow (Console Calculator)

1. Ask user for two numbers.
2. Ask for the operation (+, -, \*, /).
3. Perform calculation and print result.
4. Optionally repeat
